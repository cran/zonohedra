Description: Computes a zonohedron from real vector generators.  The package also computes zonogons (2D zonotopes) and zonosegs (1D zonotopes).  An elementary S3 class for matroids is included, which supports matroids with rank 3, 2, and 1.  Optimization methods are taken from Heckbert (1985) <https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/zono.ps.gz>.
